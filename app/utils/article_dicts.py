                "It was in early 2000 when I heard about ultrarunning for the first time. I came across a couple of articles about runners who ran across Australia and another runner who had run between the Paavo Nurmi statues in Helsinki and Turku. Those inspired me and in 2004 I ran my first ultra. It was a 6-hour race on a 400-meter track. After the race I had a feeling that I have found something profoundly new for myself. Something I had never experienced before.",

You may often find new and exciting places that you would not otherwise find. There are nice applications available which you can use in advance to plan your runs in a new place. Or you may also contact the local running community to give you a tour to the nicest locations. Running is also a very time efficient sport since you do not need to separately go to a gym or sports arena. You just open your front door at home and take the first step. Now when working from home office during the covid-19 it is quite nice to have a short break during the day and go for a run. This helps also your cognitive capabilities during the rest of the day.",

It is all about being present during your walks and becoming more connected to your body, lowering stress levels and improving performance at the same time. According to Lindsay, to achieve mindfulness while walking, first you need to leave the gear that might distract you during your walk at home. Next thing is to de-stress prior to heading outdoors by using some breathing techniques or light stretching. Before the walk, try to think a mindfulness goal for the workout, like keeping your thoughts quiet, relaxing your shoulders more, or maintaining a better posture. Start slow and pay attention to things like your breathing rate, your heartbeat, and the rhythm of your arms and legs as they move. You may feel tight or sore, or your walking technique may seem off. All these things are okay. Don’t worry about fixing them or stress about making it better.",

You might be surprised how you can actually start feeling more relaxed and looser as your walk progresses when you simply stop worrying so much about how you feel. Lindsay reminds us that part of the beauty of walking outdoors is the ability to get in tune with nature. Once you’ve found your walking rhythm, spend some time noticing your surroundings. Focus on one thing at the time, like the clouds in the sky or the fallen leaves on the ground. If you’re in a more urban environment, notice the architecture of the buildings or the different colours in your surroundings.",

Keeping your focus on what’s around you will help you be present in the moment, stay relaxed and enjoy your walk. During the last portion of your mindful walk, notice how straight or slumped your back is, how far forward ahead you’re looking, how your foot is striking the ground, and the effect gravity has on your body. Ideally, you’ll want your body as upright as possible, with your head up, your shoulders back, and your arms moving front to back instead of sideways. Once you’re close to the finish line – ease your steps and slow down for the last hundred meters. After your heart rate and breathing have calmed, breathe and reconnect with your body so it can head into a more relaxed state.",

                "text": "The fourth walk gave some ideas on how to maintain energy levels during a walk and listed five reasons that Marc Lindsay brought up in his MyFitnessPal blog post on getting tired quickly on walks. Increasing your step count with a daily walk is one of the easiest ways to start an exercise habit and improve your overall health. A gradual ramp-up is necessary as you build your aerobic endurance, but if you’re getting tired too quickly, it’s important to understand potential causes and address them. Wearing the wrong shoes or socks, having a poor diet or sedentary lifestyle are all factors that can hinder your motivation and progress. If you’re not used to regular exercise, it can be challenging to go from the couch to brisk walking for long durations, and you’ll likely tire quickly. Don’t beat yourself up over your starting point, since even 10 minutes of walking a day can help counteract the negative effects of sitting. Instead, ease yourself into longer durations by following a plan or working with a coach. Focusing on good posture can help you feel less tired and prevent injuries that would further slow you down. There can be other health issues too that make you tire more quickly. For example, when you’re overweight, your heart has to work harder to pump blood to your muscles when you move. This puts stress on the cardiovascular system and decreases your aerobic endurance. If you have asthma or pre-existing injuries like knee, back or foot problems, it’s always a good idea to get checked first before you begin an exercise routine. ",

                "text": "Lindsay’s blog posting also shared some ideas to improve the walking endurance. Based on your individual goals and lifestyle listening to music might help change your frame of mind so you can push through feelings of fatigue. Or you could follow your distance, pace and heart rate with a fitness tracker. Staying in the correct aerobic heart rate zone by adjusting your pace can help you walk for longer periods. Furthermore, pre- and post-walk stretching can help prevent injury and improve flexibility to keep your walking form at its best. And finally, a dedicated walking coach can help you build a personalized walking routine and deal with any setbacks. At Nokia, such coaching can be asked from the occupational health service provider, Aava.",

                "text": '''The final, fifth wellbeing walk was held on Thursday October 29 with the biggest topic, scanning one’s personal wellbeing. As a framing tool we used five questions to visualize the wellbeing scenery in our minds. 1) Do I live the way I want to live? 2) What brings meaning to my life? 3) What inspires me? "4") Am I at the right place in my life? "5") What gives me the motivation to get up in the mornings? 
            Sometimes it is good to stop and evaluate the current situation in life; am I running on autopilot, am I doing the right things with my life? Stop and take the needed time to identify things that matter and are important to you. Identifying and following our individual preferences bring energy to our days. A perfect time to do this kind of reflection is during a private walk when it is easy to listen to your very own thoughts as no one is disturbing. Use your walks to take time for regular self-reflection and make sure you live the kind of life you want.
